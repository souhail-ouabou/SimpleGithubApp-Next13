## Description
In the home page we have a list of courses that fetched from a route with search functionality. The courses data could be in any type of database or headless CMS. For this example, we will just use a JSON file to keep things simple. 
And also we are going to fetch data from the GitHub API. 
We are going to fetch a list of my repositories and display them on a page .
